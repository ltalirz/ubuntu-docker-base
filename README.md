# ubuntu-docker-base
Docker base image for ansible provisioning using Ubuntu.
This is useful, e.g., as a base image for testing ansible roles.

## Links and how to use it

The repository with the Dockerfile is at https://github.com/marvel-nccr/ubuntu-docker-base

You can get the image generated by the docker file by using
`docker pull marvelnccr/ubuntu-docker-base`
or equivalently
`docker pull marvelnccr/ubuntu-docker-base:latest`

The `latest` tag points to the content of the `master` branch.
If you want a different tagged version, you can check out those directly.
For instance:
`docker pull marvelnccr/ubuntu-docker-base:1.0`
checks out the content of the `v1.0` tag.
